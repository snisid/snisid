## Executive Summary

The SNISID Conflict Resolution Governance Model establishes a **five-level authority hierarchy** that routes cases to the appropriate decision-makers based on conflict severity and complexity. Auto-escalation triggers ensure that cases automatically advance when:
- Service Level Agreement (SLA) deadlines are breached
- Conflict of interest is detected
- Pattern anomalies are identified (e.g., one adjudicator with high reversal rate)
- Citizen complaints are filed

This model prioritizes **due process** (transparent decision authority), **efficiency** (clear escalation rules), and **accountability** (immutable audit trails of every escalation).

## Authority Hierarchy & Escalation Levels

### Level 1: Field Operations (Tier 1-2 Authority)
**Primary Authority:** Enrollment Agents, Biometric Adjudicators
**Geographic Scope:** Local ONI center (commune-level)
**Supervision:** ONI Center Supervisor
**Decision Scope:** 
- Tier 1 (administrative duplicates): Auto-merge if confidence ≥95%
- Tier 2 (biometric near-match 85-94%): Initial adjudication, consensus-building
**SLA:** 24-48 hours
**Escalation Path:** → Level 2 if SLA >50% elapsed or conflict of interest detected

**Level 1 Decision Authority:**
```
Tier 1 Resolution:
  Authority: Enrollment Agent + Supervisor approval
  Prerequisite: Conflict-of-interest clearance
  Dual-control: Supervisor counter-signature required
  Appeal: Can appeal to Regional Director (Level 3)
  
Tier 2 Initial Review:
  Authority: Biometric Adjudicator #1
  Prerequisite: Active biometric expert certification
  Blind review: No visibility into Tier 2 reviewer #2
  Consensus: Must achieve agreement with 2nd adjudicator OR escalate to T3
```

---

### Level 2: Regional Operations (Tier 2-3 Transitional)
**Primary Authority:** Senior Biometric Adjudicators, Biometric Quality Reviewers
**Geographic Scope:** Regional ONI center (regional authority)
**Supervision:** Regional ONI Supervisor
**Decision Scope:**
- Tier 2 (biometric near-match): Adjudicator consensus, escalation to T3 if disagreement
- Tier 3 (biometric hard-match ≥95%): Receive escalations from T2
**SLA:** 48-72 hours
**Escalation Path:** → Level 3 if adjudicators disagree or quality issues persist

**Level 2 Decision Authority:**
```
Tier 2 Consensus Decision:
  Authority: Two Biometric Adjudicators (independent review)
  Prerequisite: Both have valid biometric expert certifications
  Consensus triggers: 
    - BOTH agree MATCH → Escalate to T3 (Senior Examiner)
    - BOTH agree NOT_MATCH → Close case
    - DISAGREEMENT → Senior Examiner (tiebreaker)
  Dual-control: Supervisor spot-check (20% of cases)
  Appeal: Can appeal to Level 3 (Regional Director)
```

## Auto-Escalation Triggers

### Trigger 1: SLA Breach (Time-Based)

**50% SLA Elapsed (Alert)**
```
IF (current_time - case_created_time) > SLA_deadline * 0.50:
  ACTION: Send alert to case supervisor
  MESSAGE: "Case [CFR-YYYY-NNNNNN] is 50% through SLA. 
            Review status and provide update."
  NOTIFY: Supervisor, case assigned authority
  NO_ESCALATION: Case remains with current authority
  LOG: Audit trail records alert
```

**75% SLA Elapsed (Escalation)**
```
IF (current_time - case_created_time) > SLA_deadline * 0.75:
  ACTION: Auto-escalate case to next authority level
  PROCESS:
    1. Reassign case from current authority to next level
    2. Reset SLA timer to next-level SLA
    3. Send notification to both current and next-level authorities
  MESSAGE_TO_NEXT_LEVEL: "Case inherited: 75% of previous SLA elapsed. 
                          Complete review and decision ASAP."
  NOTIFY: Citizen - "Your case is being escalated to ensure timely 
                     resolution"
  LOG: Audit trail records escalation trigger + timestamp
```

**100% SLA Breach (Critical Escalation)**
```
IF (current_time - case_created_time) > SLA_deadline * 1.00:
  ACTION: Force escalation + incident report + governance review
  PROCESS:
    1. Auto-escalate to next level (if not already escalated)
    2. Create incident report: [INCIDENT-YYYY-NNNNNN]
    3. Flag case for governance audit
    4. Notify: Case authority's supervisor + National Director
  MESSAGE_TO_CITIZEN: "SLA breach detected. Your case is being prioritized."
  INCIDENT_REPORT_CONTAINS:
    - Original case ID
    - Authority responsible for delay
    - Time breach (how many days overdue)
    - Previous escalations (if any)
    - Action taken (force escalation)
  GOVERNANCE_REVIEW: Monthly review of all SLA breaches
  LOG: Critical escalation to immutable audit trail
```

---

### Trigger 2: Conflict of Interest Detection

**Automated Conflict Screening (at case assignment):**
```
BEFORE assigning case to authority:
  1. Pull authority's geographic home commune
  2. Check if home commune = case location
     IF YES and distance <50 km:
       DECISION: Cannot be assigned to this authority
       ACTION: Reassign to next available authority (different region)
       LOG: Conflict of interest detected + avoidance action
  
  3. Check authority's family tree (NNI relationships)
  4. Check if either conflicting NNI is in authority's family tree
     IF YES (family relationship detected):
       DECISION: Cannot be assigned (bias risk)
       ACTION: Reassign to next available authority
       LOG: Family relationship detected + avoidance action
  
  5. Check authority's prior case history with either party
  6. If prior professional relationship exists:
       DECISION: Cannot be assigned (prior bias)
       ACTION: Reassign to next available authority
       LOG: Prior professional relationship detected + avoidance action
```

**Manual Conflict-of-Interest Certification (required before final decision):**
```
BEFORE any authority signs final decision, they must certify:

[ ] I have no family relationship with either party (verified against NNI database)
[ ] I reside ≥50 km from both case locations (verified against personnel records)
[ ] I have no prior professional contact with either party 
    (verified against case history database)
[ ] I have no financial interest in outcome 
    (conflict of interest screening questionnaire)
[ ] I am aware of my obligation to disclose conflicts 
    (signed acknowledgment)

Certification Signature: _________________ Timestamp: _________________
Witness: _________________ (supervisor countersignature)
```

**Escalation if Conflict Detected (post-decision):**
```
IF conflict of interest discovered AFTER decision signed:
  1. Case status → ESCALATED
  2. Decision → RESCINDED and marked VOID
  3. Case reassigned to different authority
  4. New authority conducts complete de novo review (from scratch)
  5. Notify: Citizen, original authority's supervisor, National Director
  6. Incident report: Conflict-of-interest failure + remedial action
```

---

### Trigger 3: Pattern Detection (Behavioral Anomaly)

**Adjudicator Consensus Rate Below Threshold:**
```
MONITORING: Track consensus rate for each adjudicator (Tier 2)
TARGET: ≥90% agreement with second adjudicator (in first two independent reviews)

IF adjudicator_consensus_rate < 85% (for 10+ cases in last month):
  ACTION: Escalate for quality review
  PROCESS:
    1. Pull adjudicator's last 10 cases
    2. Senior examiner independently reviews all 10
    3. Compare: Senior examiner findings vs. adjudicator findings
    4. If disagreement rate >20%:
       - Suspend adjudicator pending retraining
       - Escalate to Regional Supervisor
       - Review adjudicator certifications + competency
  TRIGGER: Possible training deficiency or judgment error
```

**Examiner Reversal Rate Above Threshold:**
```
MONITORING: Track reversal rate for Senior Forensic Examiners (Tier 3)
TARGET: ≤10% of examiner decisions reversed on appeal

IF examiner_reversal_rate > 15% (for 10+ cases in last quarter):
  ACTION: Escalate for quality review + retraining
  PROCESS:
    1. National Director reviews examiner's disputed cases
    2. Compare: Examiner findings vs. appeal board findings
    3. If systematic error pattern detected:
       - Mandatory retraining (40+ hours)
       - Probationary period (3 months)
       - Re-certification exam required
  TRIGGER: Possible systematic methodology error or fatigue
```

**One Agent Involved in Multiple Fraud Cases:**
```
MONITORING: Track fraud allegation involvement by enrollment agent

IF (same_agent_involved_in ≥3_fraud_cases) AND 
   (all ≥2 cases confirmed fraud):
  ACTION: Escalate to Level 4 + DCPJ pattern analysis
  PROCESS:
    1. DCPJ initiates insider threat investigation
    2. Possible scenarios:
       a) Agent assisting fraudsters (insider threat)
       b) Agent conducting unauthorized re-enrollments
       c) Agent running credential mill with criminal syndicate
    3. Actions:
       - Suspend agent pending investigation
       - Audit all agent's cases from last 12 months
       - Potential criminal charges if fraud confirmed
  TRIGGER: Possible organized fraud ring using ONI infrastructure
```

---

### Trigger 4: Citizen Complaint (Citizen-Initiated Escalation)

**Citizen Files Formal Appeal:**
```
WHEN: Citizen submits formal complaint to Regional Director or 
      National Identity Appeals Board

PROCESS:
  1. Complaint registered: [APPEAL-YYYY-NNNNNN]
  2. Case automatically escalated to next authority level
  3. Complaint grounds assessed (frivolous vs. substantive)
  4. If substantive: Case review scheduled within 7 days
  5. Notification sent to original decision authority 
     (they may provide rebuttal)

TRIGGER_LEVELS:
  - Complaint filed during Tier 1-2: Escalate to Level 3
  - Complaint filed during Tier 3-4: Escalate to Level 4 NIAB
  - Complaint filed during Tier 5: Escalate to NIAB
  - Complaint filed during Tier 6: Appeal to appellate tribunal

FRIVOLOUS_COMPLAINT_CRITERIA (no automatic escalation):
  - Same complaint filed ≥2 times previously
  - Complaint submitted after appeal deadline passed
  - Complaint contains no factual basis (adjudicator properly applied rules)
  - Outcome remained unchanged after 2+ prior appeals
```

---

### Trigger 5: Expert Disagreement (Tiebreaker Escalation)

**Tier 2 Adjudicator Disagreement:**
```
IF Adjudicator_1 decision ≠ Adjudicator_2 decision:
  - MATCH ≠ NOT_MATCH
  - INCONCLUSIVE ≠ LIKELY_MATCH
  
PROCESS:
  1. Case automatically escalates to Level 3 (Senior Examiner)
  2. Examiner conducts independent T3 forensic analysis
  3. Examiner decision is binding (tiebreaker authority)
  4. Case outcome determined by examiner
  5. Both adjudicators notified of examiner's tiebreaker decision
```

**Tier 3 Examiner vs. Appeals Board Disagreement:**
```
IF Appeals Board review contradicts Senior Examiner finding:
  
PROCESS:
  1. Case escalated to Level 4 National Director
  2. National Director conducts case review
  3. One of three outcomes:
     a) Sustain examiner (Appeals Board appeal denied)
     b) Sustain appeals board (Examiner decision reversed)
     c) Hybrid decision (e.g., merge with conditions)
  4. National Director's decision is final administrative determination
  5. If citizen objects: Case escalates to Tribunal (T6 Judicial)
```

## Conflict-of-Interest Screening

### Three-Layer Screening Protocol

**Layer 1: Automated System Screening (at case assignment)**
```
Database checks (performed by system, no human intervention):
1. Geographic proximity: Authority home commune ≥50 km from case location
2. Family relationships: NNI cross-check (direct family only: spouse, parents, children)
3. Prior employment: Prior cases with either conflicting party in last 2 years
4. Financial interest: None identified (baseline check)

IF any red flag: ASSIGNMENT REJECTED
ACTION: Reassign to next available authority in different region
RESULT: Transparent assignment (citizen can review who is assigned + why)
```

**Layer 2: Authority Self-Certification (before decision)**
```
Authority must sign conflict-of-interest certification BEFORE case review:
- I have no family relationship with either party
- I reside ≥50 km from all case locations
- I have no prior professional relationship with either party
- I have no financial interest in outcome

False certification: Criminal liability (perjury statute)
PURPOSE: Personal accountability + deterrent against dishonesty
```

**Layer 3: Post-Decision Audit (after case closure)**
```
Governance audit (quarterly):
1. Random sample 20% of closed cases
2. Verify conflict-of-interest screening was properly applied
3. Check: If any undisclosed conflicts exist, reverse decision
4. If systematic pattern of conflicts: Investigate authority's integrity
5. Possible sanctions: Suspension, retraining, removal from position
```

## Override Procedures

### When Can Authority Override Auto-Decisions?

**Allowed Overrides (with proper justification):**
```
Scenario 1: T1 Auto-Merge Rejected by Supervisor
Condition: Supervisor reviews auto-merge, finds evidence error or 
           fraud concern not detected by system
Authority: Supervisor (Level 1)
Justification Required: Written statement ≥100 words explaining why 
                        auto-merge was inappropriate
Action: Case escalated to Level 2 for manual review
Log: Audit trail records override + rationale

Scenario 2: T3 Examiner Decision Appealed by Legal Counsel
Condition: Legal counsel reviews T3 forensic decision, identifies 
           potential legal issue (e.g., decision conflicts with prior 
           judicial precedent)
Authority: National Director + Legal Counsel (Level 4)
Justification Required: Written legal analysis ≥300 words explaining 
                        why examiner decision should be modified
Action: Case reopened for supplemental analysis or judicial referral
Log: Override documented with legal reasoning
```

**Prohibited Overrides (cannot be done, escalate instead):**
```
NOT ALLOWED:
- Authority X overriding same decision type made by Authority X+1 
  (e.g., supervisor overriding examiner without Legal Counsel)
- Overriding court order (only applicable court can modify)
- Overriding decision based on political pressure or citizen 
  complaint without substantive legal/factual basis
- Overriding consensus decision without new evidence or changed 
  circumstances
```
