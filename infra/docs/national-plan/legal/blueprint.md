# SNISID Legal Blueprint: National Identity & Security Framework

## 1. Statutory Objectives
The SNISID platform is established as the sole national authority for:
- Sovereign identity verification.
- Federated fraud detection and prevention.
- Inter-agency security orchestration.

## 2. Usage Constraints & Rights
- **No Mass Surveillance**: Usage for indiscriminate surveillance without judicial warrant is strictly prohibited.
- **Data Sovereignty**: All citizen data must reside within the territorial borders of the nation.
- **Right to Audit**: Citizens have the right to request a log of access to their identity records (subject to national security exemptions).

## 3. Agency Access Control
| Agency | Authorized Data Access | Operational Role |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **ANH** | Civil Status, Biometrics | Identity Custodian |
| **DGI** | Taxpayer ID, Fiscal History | Economic Validator |
| **DCPJ**| Criminal Records, Watchlists | Security Enforcer |
| **JUSTICE**| Oversight, Warrant Validation | Judicial Governor |

## 4. Mandatory Security Standards
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, mTLS for all inter-agency transit.
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable, cryptographically signed logs preserved for a minimum of 10 years.
- **Zero-Trust**: Mandatory MFA and SPIFFE-based identity for all administrative access.
