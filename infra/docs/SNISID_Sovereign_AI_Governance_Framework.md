# SNISID: Sovereign AI Governance Framework

The AI Governance Framework establishes the legal, ethical, and operational guardrails for all artificial intelligence models operating within the SNISID ecosystem, ensuring they serve the national interest with transparency and accountability.

---

## 1. Ethical Guardrails & Unbiased Intelligence

SNISID models must adhere to the **Sovereign AI Ethics Charter**.

- **Bias Mitigation**: All models undergo mandatory **Fairness Audits** to detect and eliminate bias based on protected demographic attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, or region).
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Any AI decision that results in a permanent loss of service (e.g., identity revocation) must be flagged for human secondary review.
- **Data Minimization**: AI models are trained on **Anonymized/Masked** datasets, ensuring that private citizen data is never exposed during the learning process.

## 2. Oversight API & Auditor Interface

To ensure national transparency, SNISID provides a dedicated interface for government oversight bodies.

- **Auditor Dashboard**: Provides real-time visibility into AI decision logs, model performance metrics, and bias audit results.
- **Challenge Protocol**: Allows auditors to "Flag" a specific AI decision for a comprehensive **XAI (Explainable AI) Deep-Dive**, requiring the system to provide a full logical reconstruction of the decision.
- **Model Version Control**: Every model deployment is cryptographically signed and versioned, allowing auditors to trace a decision back to the exact version of the neural network that made it.

## 3. Sovereign Model Certification

No AI model can process national identity data without obtaining a **Sovereign AI Certificate**.

- **Security Certification**: Models are tested against "Adversarial Examples" and "Model Poisoning" attacks.
- **Accuracy Certification**: Models must meet a minimum precision/recall threshold on national validation datasets before being deployed to the production mesh.
- **Explainability Requirement**: Every model must expose an API for **SHAP/LIME** explanation generation.

## 4. Governance Workflows

- **Model Onboarding**: Data Scientists submit a model -> Automated Fairness Audit -> Security Scan -> National Oversight Approval -> Certificate Issuance.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Flink monitors model performance vs. human review decisions. If a model's "Drift" exceeds 5%, it is automatically placed in "Shadow Mode" and flagged for investigation.
- **Policy Enforcement**: OPA (Open Policy Agent) acts as the final gatekeeper, ensuring that AI decisions do not violate national legal codes.

## 5. Geopolitical Alignment

The AI Governance framework is designed to align with international standards (e.g., EU AI Act) while maintaining full **Digital Sovereignty**. All model weights, training scripts, and validation datasets are stored exclusively on **Sovereign Object Storage** within national borders.
