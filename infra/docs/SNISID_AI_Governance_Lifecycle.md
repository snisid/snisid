# SNISID: AI Governance & Lifecycle Management

The Sovereign AI Governance layer ensures that the platform's intelligence is transparent, accountable, and resilient to adversarial manipulation.

---

## 1. Explainable AI (XAI) & Reasoning (Prompt 139)

National security decisions cannot be a "Black Box."

- **Sovereign Explanation Service**: For every high-risk AI decision, the system generates a **SHAP/LIME** explanation report.
- **Reasoning Chains**: The system links neural outputs with graph-based relationships (e.g., *"Flagged as Fraud Ring due to 80% shared hardware fingerprints across 5 nodes"*).
- **Auditability**: These explanations are stored in the **AI Audit Log** and are accessible to the National SOC and Judicial Oversight bodies.

## 2. Continuous Learning & Federated Intelligence (Prompt 144, 145)

- **Online Learning Loops**: Flink monitors model performance in real-time. If accuracy drops below a threshold, the **Retraining Pipeline** is automatically triggered using the latest data from the **Forensic Replay Engine**.
- **Federated Learning**: Allows regional SNISID clusters to train on local identity data without sharing raw PII. Only the "Model Gradients" are sent to the National Center to build a **Global Sovereign Model**.

## 3. Adversarial Attack Detection (Prompt 143)

SNISID protects its AI from "Evasion" and "Poisoning" attacks.

- **Adversarial Input Scrubber**: A pre-inference layer that detects malicious noise or "Adversarial Examples" designed to trick the neural network.
- **Model Drift Detection**: Continuous monitoring of the output distribution. A sudden shift in the "Average Risk Score" triggers an automated alert for potential model poisoning or a massive shift in fraud tactics.

---

## 4. AI Policy Governance & Audit (Prompt 147, 148)

- **The AI Constitution**: A set of Rego-based policies that define the "Ethical Boundaries" of AI decisions (e.g., "No decision based solely on protected demographic attributes").
- **AI Audit Ledger**: A cryptographically signed record of:
  - `Model_Version`: Which specific model made the decision?
  - `Input_Snapshot`: What was the exact data state at that time?
  - `Explanation_ID`: Link to the XAI reasoning report.

---

## 5. Ensemble Inference & Predictive Intelligence (Prompt 149, 150)

- **Ensemble Voting**: Critical decisions require a "Consensus" from multiple model architectures (e.g., Random Forest + CNN + Graph Neural Network).
- **Predictive Cyber Intelligence**: The system runs **Monte Carlo Simulations** on the national graph to predict potential future attack paths (e.g., "If Agency X is compromised, which 10 identities are at highest risk of lateral movement?").

---

## 6. Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

- **Namespace Isolation**: AI workloads are deployed in a `snisid-ai-intelligence` namespace with strict egress controls.
- **Istio Service Mesh**: All inference calls are secured with mTLS and monitored for anomalous traffic patterns between the Inference Gateway and the Model Servers.
- **Spot Instances**: Use of Kubernetes Spot Instances for non-critical retraining jobs to optimize national compute costs.
